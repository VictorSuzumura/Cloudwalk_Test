### **Explain the money flow and the information flow in the acquirer market and the role of the main players.**

The acquirer market revolves around three mains players, which are the acquirers themselves, the credit card brands and the issuing banks. It’s also important to mention the presence of customers and merchants, the people who will use the payment system. There are also the sub-acquirers and the payment gateways, which will be elucidated in the following answer. 

The acquirers are companies that process payments, allowing merchants to accept different types of payment methods. After processing the payment data of a purchase, they communicate with the credit card brands and issuing banks to validate the information, so they can complete the transaction.

Credit card brands are responsible for regulating the payment market, defining rules for credits cards, for example. They define how the acquirers must process the purchases. Those brands will receive information from the acquirers and check if they are valid. If so, then they will contact the issuing banks to confirm if the buyer has enough resources to complete the transaction.

Finally, Issuing Banks are the financial institutions responsible for the payment method (a credit card for example). They will check if the buyer has enough funds to complete the purchase and will allow or deny the transaction. Their answer is then sent back through the chain, and the acquirer will be able to allow or cancel the operation. If the purchase is confirmed, then the money goes from the Issuing Bank account to the acquirer, who will be responsible to transfer those resources to the merchant.

### **Explain the difference between acquirer, sub-acquirer and payment gateway and how the flow explained in question 1 changes for these players.**

Sub-acquirers are companies that specialize in the merchant end of the system, for whom they will provide services like those of an acquirer, but with relative ease when compared to them, allowing smaller businesses to join the payment system. When used, they send payment data to acquirers, starting the process described in the previous answer. In the same way of an acquirer, they will receive the payment and then transfer it to the merchant. 
Gateways are used in online payments. Like sub-acquirers, they need to contact acquirers to send data to them. Their main function is to collect payment information and then transfer it to the acquirer, which will validate the transaction. Their main advantage resides in the fact that the transaction amount is directly transferred to the merchant.

There are also some differences in what they offer and how much they charge. A sub-acquirer may provide fraud detection and risk management services, which are not present in gateways. As one could imagine, this could increase its costs when compared to a gateway. Nevertheless, choosing to use a gateway instead of a sub-acquirer may demand other services to secure transactions in e-commerce, increasing the cost for the merchant. 

### **Explain what chargebacks are, how they differ from cancellations and what is their connection with fraud in the acquiring world.**

Chargebacks happen when a cardholder asks its issuing bank to reverse a purchase. They are mainly used when the cardholder doesn’t recognize a transaction made with its card but can happen when there’s a problem in the transaction that can’t be solved in a friendly way. While it protects the customer by avoiding frauds like credit card cloning, it can be used in ways that may be harmful to merchants, by simply canceling normal transactions and making the merchant take all the loss. 

Cancellations differ from chargebacks because the former is a friendly way to solve a problem between the merchant and the customer, avoiding the action of third parties and generally applying rules that will reduce the effects of the cancellation to the merchant revenue. Chargebacks, on the other hand, can be very harmful and will demand the action of the issuing bank to force the reversal of the payment.
